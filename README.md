# Data-Consolidation-Script-in-Python
 This repository contains a Python script for manipulating data from a MySQL remote database table and consolidating it into another MySQL table. The script utilizes the mysql.connector library for database connectivity and the pandas library for data manipulation.  
 
 *Please take note that specifically this script is provided as a demonstration and I cannot guarantee that the permission will work anymore. By the time I’m publishing this code on Github, it is working though. Also, to access the database you may need to have your IP authorized, but for privacy reasons, I will not publish it here the e-mail address to apply. I’m keeping this code here almost as a "read-only".
